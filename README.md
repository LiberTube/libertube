## Technical Overview

LiberTube’s architecture leverages distributed nodes, encryption, and P2P data replication technologies.  
The system is modular, allowing for scalability and rapid feature development.

### **1. Node Hub**

Handles content replication, video stream requests, and load balancing.  
Ensures reliability and availability through distributed storage.

### **2. Encryption**

Provides secure user data and interactions, preventing data leaks and unauthorized access.

### **3. AI-Powered Search Engine**

Optimizes content discovery without advertising-driven algorithm manipulation.  

- **Metadata:** Enhanced search through tags and filtering.  
- **Community Contributions:** User-driven tagging improves search relevance.  

### **4. Expandability Layer**

Focused on integration and automation.  

- **REST API:** Allows external applications to interact with the platform.  
- **Custom Plugins:** Developers can add and deploy new features.  
- **Automation Scripts:** Manage content, nodes, and platform components.
